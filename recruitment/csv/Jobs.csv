<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
<p><span><strong>What do you get in return?</strong></span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Truant London is a wholly independent agency that is committed to creating a work environment that rewards its staff in a variety of ways.&nbsp; On top of your day rate, some specifics include:</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span><span> </span><span>A minimum holidays policy, all staff must take at least 5 weeks off a year, no upper limit</span></span></li>

<p><span><strong>What do we look for?</strong></span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>We need people who will run at things, at pace, and with good humour and positive energy.&nbsp; An entrepreneurial spirit is a must, as is a desire to leave a mark.&nbsp; We need someone to take responsibility for their role, and help others with theirs, to be part of something, and to help shape it further.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>We think the following gives a good steer as to the type of business we are and the type of people we look for.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span><strong><em>Good Truant/Bad Truant</em></strong></span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants want to build something great.&nbsp; Bad Truants want to be part of something already built.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants make things happen. Bad Truants wait for things to happen.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants take responsibility when things go bad and give praise to others when things go well.&nbsp; Bad Truants blame the client, the supplier, the colleague, the process.&nbsp; Bad Truants look for excuses, Good Truants look to find a way through, no excuses.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants contribute to building agency culture and embrace a group mentality.&nbsp; They want to be part of the gang, they stand up for their mates in a fight, they buy into the idea that the group is bigger than the individual. Bad Truants want to have their own gang.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Truants think we, not me.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants will understand the context of their work, whether it be strategic, creative or client service.&nbsp; They will grasp the bigger picture and the collective aim.&nbsp; Bad Truants will get annoyed that everything impacts them, and their job.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants use their time wisely, prioritizing activities and work in a way that benefits the agency.&nbsp; Bad Truants spend every minute reacting to things and firefighting.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants anticipate when things need attention before they become a problem.&nbsp; They do this by building knowledge on accounts, culture, clients, and picking up on anything that might be problematic.&nbsp; Good Truants will try and bring an action plan to the table.&nbsp; Bad Truants will write it off as unworkable.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants make the founders think twice about decisions across the business from processes and pitches to creative and strategy.&nbsp; Bad Truants go along with the status quo for a quiet life and have little opinion on how things are done.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants do their jobs properly, promptly, passionately.&nbsp; They deliver on time, they’re clear communicators, they pay close attention to the smallest of details.&nbsp; They know nothing is too small to check or clarify.&nbsp; Bad Truants think the small details aren’t important.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants find the holes in the business (there are many) and come up with strategies to fill them.&nbsp; Bad Truants put up with the imperfections, at-best working around them, or at-worst using them as excuses for poor performance.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Good Truants will want to leave us and start their own company one day.&nbsp; And we’ll support that.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span><strong>What makes us special?</strong></span></p> 
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p> 
<p><span>Truant is a unique agency build upon a promise to deliver an unfair share of attention for brands, causes and ourselves.&nbsp; Our advertising, media &amp; music proposition gives us a unique set of core competencies all under one roof, working together to create work that stands out.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Our collective ambition is to build a creative business unlike any other, and one that we would be happy to work with for the rest of our lives. And to guide us we’ve built a set of principles that act as the DNA to the business, those being:</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><span><span> </span><span>We want to be <strong>respected</strong> for the work we do.</span></span></li> 
 <li><span><span> </span><span>We want to act <strong>responsibly </strong>in all that we do.</span></span></li> 
 <li><span><span> </span><span>We want to be a <strong>rewarding</strong> place to work.</span></span></li> 
 <li><span><span> </span><span>We want to have a <strong>rebellious </strong></span></span></li> 
</ul> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>The people we hire all share this ambition and are actively involved in making it all happen.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>Truant isn’t perfect, it’s a ten-year-old start up.&nbsp; That can be thrilling and scary all at once. It’s a place for experimenting, for tinkering, and for going against all the conventions in agency-world.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span>There would be no point creating a business that was like everyone else, so we’re committed to trying to push things forward, and we’re looking for like-minds to join us on that journey.</span></p>

  <li><span>Engine’s ‘standby’ contract with the UK Government. This means turning complex policy into effective communications.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><strong>Strategy Director – Job description</strong></p> 
<p><strong>First things first, what is and who are Teamspirit?</strong></p> 
<p>Teamspirit is an award-winning specialist, full-service marketing agency with a team of approximately 90 spirited individuals. Over our 25-year history we’ve won over 100 awards for marketing effectiveness, creativity, innovation, and insight. For the most part specialise in financial and professional services, however as we’re part of the wider VCCP business group we share clients from across a wider spectrum of industry sectors including technology, energy, and utilities. As a business we are passionate about transforming financial services through the development of iconic campaigns and customer experiences. We always focus on the customer and help translate the often-complex world of finance into the compelling to create emotional and more meaningful relationships between brands and their customers. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>As for what makes us tick here’s a list of what we value:</p> 
<p>· <strong>Social </strong>– we believe that great work is best created through strong teams that know how to work together</p> 
<p>· <strong>Curious </strong>– we value curiosity as this leads to continuous questioning, learning and more imaginative ideas</p> 
<p>· <strong>Open </strong>– we encourage openness as this leads to better ideas, quicker, ideas that are authentic and resonate with us at a human level not just</p> 
<p>· <strong>Responsible </strong>– we see finance as a force for good in the world and we reflect that by giving our team the authority and support they need to deliver</p> 
<p>· <strong>Entrepreneurial </strong>– we want people to pursue opportunities they believe add the greatest value for the agency, our clients and society.</p> 
<p>· <strong>Expert </strong>– We believe that a passion for marketing and an enthusiasm for finance creates a better understanding or the challenges and opportunities for iconic work that helps both client and customer alike so we like people to be true consultants.</p> 
<p><strong>The role</strong></p> 
<p>We are searching for a new Strategy Director to complement our team and help manage a small group of clients one of which is one of the agencies biggest with a series of international offices and multiple business divisions.</p> 
<p><strong>Our ideal candidate</strong></p> 
<p>We’d ideally like a candidate that has had several years’ experience as a senior creative strategist but is looking to take the next step and take on possibly a bigger challenge and more responsibility.</p> 
<p><strong>Skills and experience:</strong></p> 
<p>A proven competency in strategic marketing with a minimum 6 years agency or client side experience</p> 
<p><strong>Reports and responsibilities</strong></p> 
<p>The new Strategy Director will report into and work alongside Teamspirit’s Chief Strategy Director.</p> 
<p>As well as working with the wider strategy team the new director will also have responsibility for mentoring and overseeing a new junior strategist within the team<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>What Teamspirit wants from a new Strategy Director:</strong></p> 
<p>Having had agency and or client experience and responsibilities previously the below shouldn’t be too much of a surprise.</p> 
<p>1. To act as the guardian of strategic planning process for their client account, working directly with the account handling teams to constantly deliver great client outcomes</p> 
<p>2. To provide full strategic support and insight for creative briefs, providing strategic direction to the creative team and help create great creative work.</p> 
<p>3. To build positive relationships with senior client contacts and other agencies that the client might work with to embody our Teamspirit philosophy</p> 
<p>4. To take responsibility for the overall media and communications planning for the client account and the distinct campaigns, including discipline selection, media weighting and mix, including social and a basic understanding of lead nurture activity</p> 
<p>5. To work with the account team to pro-actively develop the client’s business from a strategic perspective, understanding how their business model, distribution and propositions are evolving and establishing a vision of possible market opportunities</p> 
<p>6. To build a deep knowledge and more technical understanding of the client’s products, marketplace and applicable regulation and legislation. This is because FS is a highly regulated market and as a specialist knowing the difference between pre and post pension crystallisation taxation is important. That said we don’t expect our candidate to have that knowledge on day one.</p> 
<p><strong>Wider expectations</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Become part of Teamspirit</strong></p> 
<p>We’d like our new team member to get involved in wider company initiatives outside of their day-to-day role. This might be joining our book club, our pro bono work or any of our wider business focused groups such as the people team or the social team. What we want is someone to add to team not just the work.</p> 
<p><strong>Support new business:</strong></p> 
<p>The last piece of the long list of desires is we’d like the new strategy director to also support Teamspirit’s new business efforts whether that’s leading on an opportunity or supporting with insights or acting as a pitch doctor or critic.</p> 
<p><strong>Teamspirit our approach, our process, and the package</strong></p> 
<p><strong>A collaborative culture</strong></p> 
<p>We’re a creative business first and foremost and believe that the best work comes from an inclusive and collaborative workplace. As such we actively support diversity amongst our team, be that ethnicity, social background, or educational attainment. So we actively want to invite all candidate with the relevant experience or possibly transferable skills to apply for this role.</p> 
<p><strong>Hybrid working</strong></p> 
<p>Over the past years like most service-based industries we have adopted a hybrid working model and now our standard contract is based upon a flexible balance of 2 days in the office with the other remaining days working from home or client offices as needed.</p> 
<p><strong>Our process</strong></p> 
<p>We see the process as having three phases</p> 
<p>1. The accumulation of possible candidate CV’s and review to then select a group of approximately 6-8 candidates for an initial interview with the CSO This group will then be reduced to four candidates that will be invited to complete the second task</p> 
<p>2. The completion of a strategic task and presentation to help the team understand the way a candidate approaches a creative challenge and how quickly they can get to grips with a distinct market sector. This will be conducted by the strategy team and a representative from both the creative and account management teams</p> 
<p>3. A final two candidates will be invited to meet Teamspirit’s CSO and CEO to discuss the role in detail before a final selection and offer is made.</p> 
<p><strong>Teamspirit contact</strong></p> 
<p>This process is being conducted by David McCann Teamspirit’s Group Strategy Director. My contact details are <a href=""mailto:dmccann@teamspirit.uk.com"" rel=""nofollow""><u>dmccann@teamspirit.uk.com</u></a> and my mobile is 07825 081 358</p> 
<p><strong>Benefits and package</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the customer strategy function at BBH is to help brands liberate the potential of their first party data to create value for their customers, and themselves.</p> 
<p>Despite the use of the word ‘data’ above, this is not a ‘data’ job.</p> 
<p>Instead, the job is to turn data of all kinds into insights and stories that lead to great behaviour-driving work that helps brands grow.</p> 
<p>That work could be a great ad, a great journey, or a great loyalty programme.</p> 
<p>Customer Marketing is an integral part of our offering to all clients. It is not a department, it is a specialism. As a Customer Strategist, you will be a member of one of the largest, most diverse and most awarded strategy teams in London.</p> 
<p>You will be expected to contribute to the team’s thinking on communications and effectiveness from the point of view of a customer marketer. In return, you will have the opportunity to learn from seniors and peers who are equally skilled in their disciplines, from brand advertising to social media.</p> 
<p>You will report to a Customer Strategy Director.</p> 
<p>The culture</p> 
<p>At BBH, our objective is effectiveness and our strategy is creativity.</p> 
<p>Our core belief is the power of difference to make a difference.</p> 
<p>As such, we celebrate diversity of backgrounds and of thinking styles.</p> 
<p>To this end, we call ourselves Black Sheep. Because you can alway count on a black sheep not to follow the herd.</p> 
<p>The person</p> 
<p>● Is probably between 3 and 5 years into their career.</p> 
<p>● Is experienced in supporting a Strategy Director in the development of client presentations and is confident writing creative briefs.</p> 
<p>● Has a knack for rapidly distilling large amounts of data of all forms into actionable insights and recommendations, with the guidance of a Strategy Director.</p> 
<p>● Is excited to learn about all forms of communication strategy while remaining a customer strategist at heart.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>● Is confident but humble, capable of defending their arguments while using others’ points of view to refine their position.</p> 
<p>● Tells stories well, in writing, in numbers, and on charts. We do not expect star performance at this from day one, but the desire to develop this talent is essential.</p> 
<p>● Above all, has an outstanding ability to make the complex simple. This is the essential prerequisite for success as a strategist at BBH.</p> 
<p>Working arrangements</p> 
<p>While we operate flexibly, this is an office-based role. We will expect this person to spend the majority of their time in our amazing Soho office.</p> 
<p>This is for the benefit of the individual as much as our own. BBH has been called the university of advertising. More time on site means more time to learn from others.</p>

<p>You will be expected to contribute to the team’s thinking on communications and effectiveness from the point of view of a customer marketer, bringing a perspective that includes such concepts as customer value management and behavioural psychology.</p> 
<p>In return, you will have the opportunity to learn from peers who are equally skilled in their disciplines, from brand advertising to social media.</p> 
<p>You will report to a Group Strategy Director. This role will involve the management and mentorship of a strategist.</p>

<p>To this end, we call ourselves Black Sheep. Because you can alway count on a black sheep not to follow the herd.</p> 
<p>The person</p> 
<p>● Is probably between five and ten years into their career.</p> 
<p>● Is experienced in the creation of CRM programmes from the ground up.</p>

<p>About us</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Pulse Agency is the latest expansion of the Brand Partnership Group. In a nutshell, Pulse</p> 
<p>works with marketing agencies, start-ups and brands to provide them the actionable insight,</p> 
<p>data and strategy to support them in understanding their consumer, the marketplace and</p> 
<p>macro trends that are changing at pace. Pulse provides an invaluable perspective to</p> 
<p>support business strategy.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Following the successful launch of the business in August 2021, we’ve gone from strength to</p> 
<p>strength, with a number of new client wins and, as we look to 2022, we’re looking to grow</p> 
<p>even further and now need a fantastically talented, hands-on, all-action Strategy Account</p> 
<p>Manager to join our growing agency.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>About the role</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As a Strategy Account Manager, you’ll be supported by Lead Strategist and Insight Manager</p> 
<p>to deliver the following:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>• The creation and delivery of ‘Pulse reports’. These are generated to provide clarity,</p> 
<p>understanding and answers to client challenges that can span sales dips, consumer</p> 
<p>engagement, growth initiatives, commercial frameworks. One week you might be</p> 
<p>supporting a start-up to better understand its potential customer base and the next</p> 
<p>week, supporting a marketing agency validate its propositions ahead of a pitch</p> 
<p>• You’ll do this by aggregating different data sets together including secondary</p> 
<p>insights, investigating data on our paid-for insight and research platforms and, in</p> 
<p>some cases, undertaking bespoke/commissioned research which will be managed</p> 
<p>by our Insight Manager. The critical element is your ability to disseminate the insights</p> 
<p>and present with strong storytelling and clear actionable insights that the client can</p> 
<p>easily understand and progress. To give you a flavour on our approach, here’s an</p> 
<p>example of a Pulse Report here</p> 
<p>• For some of our clients we work on a retained/subscription style contract (and this is</p> 
<p>something we’re looking to grow). Your role, in partnership with the Insight Manager</p> 
<p>and Head of Strategy, will be to manage these accounts and deliver consistent and</p> 
<p>always-on relevant insights and ideas to cement the value we add – and help grow</p> 
<p>repeat business</p> 
<p>• You’ll also support our new business efforts with the creation of new business content</p> 
<p>such as gated content that we can host on our website to encourage downloads</p> 
<p>and data capture.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>About you</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>• A strong, compelling communicator both in talking, and in writing</p> 
<p>• Curiosity - an appetite to learn, grow and pioneer</p> 
<p>• The ability to analyse data sets and dig out those insights that will drive action (we</p> 
<p>also love excel) – and shape client strategies</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p> </p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>• You’ll be able to think big and outside the box, and then knit together a clear</p> 
<p>and cohesive proposition</p> 
<p>• It’s essential that you’re able to develop and deliver compelling ‘storytelling’</p> 
<p>presentations (we love PowerPoint) that engage the audience, are clearly</p> 
<p>navigated and loaded with substance</p> 
<p>• The drive to succeed</p> 
<p>• Keen commercial eye aligned to KPI setting and measurement</p> 
<p>• Experience and/or understanding on the value and approach to creating and</p> 
<p>delivering quantitative research</p> 
<p>• Someone excited about joining a small, independent team who wants to add</p> 
<p>their passion and excitement into the mix</p> 
<p>• Someone fearless, with a can-do, solution-driven approach</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We aim to both employ and empower talent that truly and proudly reflects the cultural diversity surrounding us.</p> 
<p>The campaigns we create are engaged with by people across multiple nations, as well as our gloriously multicultural homeland. So needless to say, reflecting the audiences we speak to couldn’t be more important.</p> 
<p>We know the best ideas are born from broad, inclusive minds that span all races, religions, ethnicities, genders and orientations - and that the happiest workplaces are made up of those who feel comfortable and confident to be their very best selves. By employing a mixture of talent that fairly represents the creativity of our industry and the wider world, we can achieve both.</p> 
<p>Your career at Initials</p> 
<p>We strive for a family culture that encourages our People to be imaginative, entrepreneurial, switched-on, progressive, determined, pragmatic, energised and supportive.</p> 
<p>People and clients tend to stay with us for the duration. Our independence gives us the freedom to invest in our talent.

<p>1. Access to career training and enhancement opportunities – educational lunches, funding of industry qualifications where appropriate, individual skill enhancement where appropriate.</p> 
<p>2. Constant feedback on progress being made. We want people to be ambitious to</p> 
<p>develop.</p> 
<p>3. An environment free from hierarchy, with senior management working closely with all teams, which is great for a collaborative and a fun working environment.</p> 
<p>4. Monthly company meetings with access to how the company is progressing</p> 
<p>financially and a celebration of great work happening in the agency each month.</p> 
<p>5. Support for your views – whatever level you are at INITIALS, we listen to opinions, and if there is something you need, want, aspire to, we try and deliver (within reason!)</p> 
<p>6. An ‘Organised Fun Club’ made up of a group of agency folk set on making</p> 
<p>INITIALS’ social festivities nights to remember (or not, as the case may be!)</p> 
<p>7. The chance to get out and about – Every month we encourage everyone in the agency to take an afternoon or morning away from their desk and to do something cultural then share their experiences with the agency.</p> 
<p>8. 24 days holiday, plus the 3 days between Christmas and New Year. Then an</p> 
<p>additional day’s holiday for every year at the agency (after two full years). And your birthday off!</p>

<p>Founded in Spring 2006 by a group of experienced and award-winning agency principles, Initials has become one of the UK’s fastest growing independent creative agencies.

<p>Our areas of expertise are; Brand Development &amp; Activation, Shopper Marketing, Ecommerce, Content, CRM and Technology.</p>

On our door- step are top-notch places to eat, drink, sweat and shop. That said, we have recently launched a work from where you work best policy. We’ll explain more to interested candidates, but the phrase hopefully speaks for itself in terms of the trust we are happy to invest in our colleagues.</p>
